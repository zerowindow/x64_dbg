<P><STRONG>The basics</STRONG><BR>This page covers the 
basic principles of plugin development for x64_dbg.</P>
<P><STRONG>Exports</STRONG><BR>A plugin has at least one 
export. This export must be called <U>pluginit</U>. See the PLUG_INITSTRUCT and 
the plugin headers for 
more information. The other valid exports are:</P>
<P><U>plugstop</U>: called when the plugin is about to be 
unloaded. Remove all registered commands and 
callbacks here. Also clean up plugin data.</P>
<P><U>plugsetup</U>: Called when the plugin initialization 
was successful, here you 
can register menus and other GUI-related things.</P>
<P><U>CB*</U>: Instead of calling _plugin_registercallback, 
you can create a CDECL export which has the name of the callback. For example 
when you create an export called "CBMENUENTRY", this will be registered as your 
callback for the event CB_MENUENTRY. Notice that you should <STRONG>not</STRONG>      
    
use an underscore in the export name.</P>
<P><U>CBALLEVENTS</U>: An export with the name "CBALLEVENTS" 
will get every event registered to it. This is done      
    
prior to registering optional other export names.</P></BODY></HTML>
