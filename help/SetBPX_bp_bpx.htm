<P><STRONG>SetBPX[,bp,bpx]</STRONG><BR>Set an INT3 (SHORT/LONG)&nbsp;or UD2 breakpoint 
and optionally assign a name to it.</P>
<P><U>arguments<BR></U>&nbsp; arg1: Address to put a breakpoint on. This can be an API name&nbsp;[not      
      implemented].</P>
<P>      
      [arg2]: Name of the breakpoint, use quotation marks to 
include spaces. This name can be used      
      by the EnableBPX, DisableBPX and DeleteBPX functions as alias, 
but is mainly intended to provide a single line of information about the 
currently-hit breakpoint. When arg2 equals to a      
      valid type (arg3) the type is used and arg2 
is      
      ignored.</P>
<P>      
      [arg3]: Breakpoint type. Can be one of the following 
options      
      in random order: "ss" (single shot breakpoint), "long" (CD03), 
"ud2" (0F0B) and "short" (CC). You can combine the "ss" option 
with one of the type options in one string. Example: "SetBPX 00401000,"entrypoint",ssud2" will set a 
single shot&nbsp;UD2&nbsp;breakpoint at 00401000 with the name "entrypoint".      
      When specifying no type or just the type "ss" 
the default type will be used. Per default this equals to the 
"short" type. You can change the default type using the "SetBPXOptions"      
      command.</P>
